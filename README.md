## DNN Alpha Contracts
DNN uses a variety of contracts that work together to make up the DNN network. Paramount to the success of the platform is having complete transparency surrounding the implementations of these contracts. Therefore, we would like to invite the community to perform complete audits on the DNN network smart-contracts.

## What is DNN?
Decentralized News Network is a political news platform that combines news creation with
decentralized networks as a means to delivering factual content, curated by the community of
readers, writers, and reviewers.

DNN will harness the power of the Ethereum blockchain to create infrastructure that is virtually
impossible to infiltrate or take down. Since DNN is not centralized, it does not have a potential single point of failure. The platform’s core purpose is to present political news as accurately as possible, free of any corrupt incentives or hidden agendas, which plagues most news
corporations.

The DNN platform will focus on facilitating the dissemination of balanced and factual observation of current political affairs. DNN's mission is to create political news content that is both empowering for its readers, as well as representative of the integrity of its writers. DNN aspires to become the most-trusted and  democratic political news alternative to the mainstream media.
